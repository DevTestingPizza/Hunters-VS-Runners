# Hunters VS Runners

A gamemode for FiveM servers.

**Currently WIP, definitely not even close to being playable.**


Basically there are 2 teams.


### Hunters
People on this team will try to use bombs (dropped from their planes) to kill all the runners before the runners reach the finish line.
The Hunters do _not_ have any indicator of where the finish line is, so they will just have to guess how much time they have left before a runner reaches the finish line.

### Runners
The runners will have to reach the finish line (and go through all the checkpoints on the way) without being blown up. If you blow up then you're out (you'll be able to spectate your teammates).
As soon as one of the runners reaches the finish line, all runners will automatically win the game.



## Time limit
There is a time limit of 5 minutes per round. If all of the runners are dead or the 5 minute limit has been reached, and none of the runners have made it to the finish line yet then the Hunters will automatically win the game. This is to prevent runners from camping under bridges or in tunnels.


As soon as a game is over, teams will swap and a new game will launch.


## Some planned features

- Implement a map voting system.
- Implement spectating.
- Make an actual working prototype.
- Disable physical contact between the planes and the runners. This way people can't just 'Kamikaze' their planes into the runners.
- (currently #1 priority & WIP) Add a lobby system using Frontnd Menus.

No, you're not allowed to steal my work.
It's not even working yet, so don't bother trying to run this.
